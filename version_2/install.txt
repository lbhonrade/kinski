     __________________________________________________________________

Downloading the System

	Download and extract the system at http://kinski.googlecode.com located at the 
	download section. 
	 
General Installation Considerations

   Before installing the system, a web server package is required. WAMP was used in making
   the system. Other Web Server Packages can also be used, but WAMP is recommended. Remember 
   to run the package whenever you will start the system. For more information about WAMP 
   server, visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAMP.
   
	Extract the file downloaded from Kinski @ Google Codes at /www/cmsc128proj subdirectory of 
	the WAMP Server. You have to create a subdirectory called cmsc128proj. It is usually at 
	C:/wamp/www by default.
	
	After you have extracted the file, run wampmanager.exe located at C:/wamp/. 
	
	Install the casdbms.sql on the database. The database name should be casdbms. The username is
	root and there is no password.
	
	You can now run the system at your respective web browsers. Type http://localhost/cmsc128proj/ 
	to open the project.
	
	Log in using the username 'admin' and password 'kinski'.
	
	Have fun!
